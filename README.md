# qwantzKit
 (GIMP Project) Create your own Dinosaur Comics.

qwantzKit is a small project for everyone who's thought, "Hmm. I'd like to make a couple of those comic things. I wonder if there's an open-source way to make those comic things on GIMP." (And who hasn't!)

## What do I do with this?

I don't know, whatever you want. You clicked on it.

Although, if you end up making a neat comic, you should probably email it to ryan@qwantz.com. He would totally probably love to see it!

If you have any info that would make this template better, just submit an issue or a PR.

## What *CAN* I do with this?

According to the Qwantz website, you can share Dinosaur Comics wherever you want, as long as it's non-commercial. (Otherwise, shoot him an email.) Similarly, you can share any comics you make with this template wherever you want, along with the template itself, within the limits of the GPL-3. 

I don't mind if you edit the copyright text on the bottom and take my name out, but I encourage you to leave Ryan's in.

## Top-Secret Information

(How the sausage is made)

The font that T-Rex, Dromiceiomimus, Utahraptor, etc. speak in is included as a tool preset. **GOD AND THE DEVIL** use the God font, but superimposed on itself 1 pixel to the right. (Duplicate the layer, move it one pixel to the right, then merge the layers.) I haven't figured out the font for *the raccoons and cephalopods* or Morris the Bug yet. I'll ask Ryan when I get the chance.

To load the fonts as tool presets, go to Preferences > Folders > Tool Presets and add the qwantzKit folder.

I haven't found the exact way to replicate the dialogue lines (the lines pointing from the speaker to the text) in GIMP. It's not exactly a 1-size line, but not exactly a 2-size line. The best way seems to be to draw a 1-pixel line, then another adjacent to it.

## Has Mr. North himself seen this?

Not yet.
